The contents, interpretations and representations of the resource are selected according to the demands of the present, an imagined past provides resources for a heritage that is to be passed onto an imagined future. It follows too that the meanings and functions of memory and tradition are defined in the present. Further, heritage is more concerned with meanings than material artefacts. It is the former that give value, either cultural or financial, to the latter and explain why they have been selected from the near infinity of the past. In turn, they may later be discarded as the demands of present societies change, or even, as is presently occurring in the former Eastern Europe, when pasts have to be reinvented to reflect new presents. Thus, heritage is as much about forgetting as remembering the past. \")\n",

So if a puddle is persistent, then the first thing we can deduce is that the ground beneath the puddle is either nonporous or extremely wet. This is mainly interesting when we travel through a rural area and notice that the number of puddles suddenly increases, despite there not being any more rain in that area. This is a sign that the rocks beneath your feet have probably changed, even if the appearance of the mud has not changed. Since the rocks are responsible for a lot of the characteristics of the soil in an area and the soil strongly influences the types of plants and animals you will find, a sudden change in the number of puddles, without a very local downpour, is a sign that the rocks, soil, plants and animals all around you will also have changed.\")\n",

Understanding how what you are doing today benefits you today and not just somewhere down the road is an essential part of personal motivation.

For example, when writing the manuscript for this book, I spent many a morning procrastinating because I could only see the big picture. The big picture overwhelmed me! The ability to break a goal down into manageable pieces is important to motivation. When I saw that if I only did some work every day, I would eventually reach my goal of finishing an enormous project, I was motivated to do a little bit every day. I began to enjoy the journey of writing when I saw how writing every day benefitted me today and not just at some time in the future.

Mr. Schelling replied, “You are right. I did omit the G flat because I never wrote a G flat at that particular point in my original score.” That surprised Maestro Toscanini, so he invited Mr. Schelling to look at the score with him. After looking at the score, it was Mr. Schelling who was surprised, and he said, Mr. Toscanini, I did omit the G flat. In all the times I have played this piece I always omitted the G flat.

    "text.append(\"By the end of the millennium, emotions had become such a central part of psychology’s focus that many scholars viewed emotions as the motivational force guiding almost all of human behavior. Today, many psychological scientists agree that any decision we make, any relationship we pursue, any thing we want — all these judgments, behaviors, and desires are influenced by emotion. Even those decisions which, we believe, are shaped by rationality or logical principles about what is right or good are in fact more often triggered by a gut emotional response. We tell ourselves that such decisions aren’t driven by our emotions, and that we are relying on the mind’s most sophisticated reasoning processes, but research shows that we are very good at coming up with “sophisticated” reasons to justify what we want to think, and what we want to think is almost always shaped by how we feel.\")\n",

While there is certainly room and a need for some manufactured plastic in our lives, we also need to make much more room for simple, natural materials. Does your children’s toy selection show an adequate representation of nature? Is there wood? Cloth? Natural fibers? Not only do these toys feel good to play with and connect children to the outside world, but they are also often strong enough to last a lifetime and even more. I think we should consider our toy materials in the same way that people talk about whole foods: the closer to the original source, the better. Can you picture your toy growing somewhere on the earth? Wooden blocks, felt balls, and cotton dolls are often some of the best toys. \")\n",
    "text.append(\"A particular difficulty that attends efforts to determine the extent of cross-cultural convergence in emotional expression is the fact that cultures do not categorize emotions in the same way. Marc Benamou, studying the use of affective terms to describe the expressive character of music among Western and Javanese subjects, ascertained that some Javanese emotion terms did not straightforwardly correspond to Western categories. This raises some doubts about how much we can trust studies that purport to compare cultures. Presumably, we can assume that when Javanese subjects report expressiveness in music using words for which English-speaking subjects have no term, the two groups of subjects are not recognizing the same expressive content. But more generally, we should be alert to the possibility that imperfect translations lead us to imagine greater agreement about musical expression than we would find if we had a more nuanced sense of the way the terms are used in the respective languages.\")\n",
    "text.append(\"To know whether an artistic performance succeeds or fails requires that we know what counts as success or failure in any performance context. Music critics will consider a pianist’s tone, phrasing, tempo, accuracy, and ability to sustain a line or build to a climax. Speed and brilliance may be important considerations, which is not to say the fastest performance will be the best. But behind these considerations is an unstated assumption: that it is one person’s ten unaided fingers that produce the sounds. The excitement a virtuoso pianist generates with a glittering shower of notes is intrinsically connected with this fact. An aurally identical experience that is electronically synthesized can never dazzle us in the same way: sound synthesizers can produce individual notes as fast as you please, while pianists cannot. Built into the thrill of hearing a virtuoso is admiration for what the performance represents as a(n) human achievement. Forgery and other forms of fakery in the arts misrepresent the nature of the performance and so misrepresent achievement.\")\n",
    "text.append(\"The story of how milk became America’s drink combines the perfection of industry with the perfection of consumer knowledge. For example, Spencer and Blanford attribute the increase in milk drinking to “significant improvements in the quality of milk and cream sold,” which led to a “more generous use of those products.” Consumers drank more milk because they had “greater knowledge of the food value of milk,” which was the result of “favorable teaching and publicity based on important findings and research.” In other words, the rise of milk consumption, according to these economic studies, is due to the increasing perfection of milk — in both quality and price — and education of consumers about this perfection. The history of milk drinking becomes a history of this increased perfection through increased consumption and through a public/private promotion of the product.\")\n",
    "text.append(\"Research suggests that a person’s level of self-complexity can have important consequences, particularly when people are confronted with negative events or difficulties in a given life domain. Imagine learning that you did poorly on a midterm exam. If you’re someone who is high in self-complexity — that is, you define yourself in terms of many nonoverlapping domains (for example, student, avid skier, committed volunteer, enthusiastic fan of Glee) — the negativity that results from your poor exam grade is relatively contained, affecting only how you feel about yourself as a student. But if you’re low in self-complexity such that your identity as a student overlaps to a great extent with the few other identities you have — then the negativity associated with your poor exam grade is likely to lower your evaluations of yourself as a student as well as spill over and affect how you evaluate your other, overlapping identities. In short, putting all your “self eggs” in one basket can be risky in the face of threatening, self-relevant events.\")\n",

The reason for the move was that another video store had opened downtown and was already operating successfully. Businesses of a particular type tend to gather together in the same part of town.

If you set up your business near a competitor, you avoid losing any advantage that their location gives them. You also give yourself the chance You also give yourself the chance to steal customers away from them. As more theatres cluster together, the area becomes known as the theatre district.

But whatever the source of the images in our sleeping brains may be, we need to be cautious about interpreting our own dreams or anyone else’s. A recent study of people showed that individuals are biased and self-serving in their dream interpretations, accepting those that fit in with their preexisting beliefs or needs and rejecting those that do not.

However, even automated responses need to be phrased appropriately. Some years ago, a clothing company used to send out an automated reply that read, “While we cannot get back to you personally, we do appreciate your input.” That response didn’t provide much satisfaction or a feeling of connectivity. Researchers Judy Strauss and Donna Hill, in one of the first major studies covering consumer complaints sent by e-mail, found that less than half (47 percent) of the firms studied created higher customer satisfaction with their in-kind e-mail responses.

Both nuclear power and hydropower are emission-free, and so alleviate the most common negative consequence of fossil-fuel-based energy production, air pollution. However, they suffer from other environmental problems that make them unattractive to some advocates of alternative energy solutions. Nuclear power produces highly radioactive wastes that must be stored and safely disposed of for long periods of time, and hydroelectric power traditionally comes from large dams that block free-flowing rivers and disturb natural riverine ecosystems. Newer forms of smaller, run-of-river hydroelectric plants avoid the negative consequences of large dams and reservoirs, but their potential physical implementation is limited and so they will never serve as the predominant solution to worldwide energy needs. Nuclear power and hydropower therefore, as with most alternative energy sources, solve some problems but not others.\")\n",

By this accounting, there are no objective goals in novels, only the subjective goal of seeking the law that is necessarily created by the individual.

In favorable cases, we can correct for the differences between ancient and modern foraging worlds.

The ancient-to-modern transition would tend to reduce the significance of a class of important features of ancient forager lifeways, ones that make cooperation more important.

It is no accident that modern science took root and flourished in a basically Christian society. Copernicus was a canon of the Catholic Church. Kepler studied the heavens believing that they manifested the wisdom and beauty of God. Newton formulated the laws of nature in the belief that the wise author of nature must have ordered the cosmos in accordance with rational and comprehensible principles.

For example, chimpanzees have a brain size of 367 centimeters and an individual's personal network typically has 57 other individuals in it. The smaller-brained macaque has a brain of 63 cms? and 40 network partners.

This view suggests that runners create soft legs that soak up impact forces when they are running on very hard surfaces and stiff 1685 when they are moving along on yielding terrain. As a result, impact forces passing through the legs are strikingly similar over a wide range of running surface types. Contrary to popular belief, running on concrete is not more damaging to the legs than running on soft sand.\")\n",
    "text.append(\"Since human beings are at once both similar and different, they. should be treated equally because of both. Such a view, which grounds equality not in human uniformity but in the interplay of uniformity and difference, builds difference into the very concept of equality, breaks the traditional equation of equality with similarity, and is immune to monist distortion. Once the basis of equality changes so does its content. Equality involves equal freedom or opportunity to be different, and treating human beings equally requires us to take into account both their similarities and differences. When the latter are not relevant, equality entails uniform or identical treatment; when they are, it requires differential treatment. Equal rights do not mean identical rights, for individuals with different cultural backgrounds and needs might in respect of whatever happens to be the content of their rights. Equality involves not just rejection of irrelevant differences as is commonly argued, but also full recognition of legitimate and relevant ones.\")\n",

American anthropology emphasizes the cultural. It assumes that culture shapes social institutions by providing the shared beliefs, the core values, the communicative tools, and so on that, make social life possible.

It has been argued that we should construct our general theories, deduce testable propositions and prove or disprove them against the sampled data. In fact, the application of this ‘scientific method’ often ran into difficulties. The data have a tendency to lead to unexpected questions, problems and issues. Thus, archaeologists claiming to follow hypothesis-testing procedures found themselves having to create a fiction. In practice, their work and theoretical conclusions partly developed from comparisons of data in other fields. In other words, they already knew the data when they decided upon an interpretation.

This is why Leonardo da Vinci advised artists to discover their motifs by staring at patches on a blank wall. A fire provides a constant flickering change in visual information that never integrates into anything solid and thereby allows the brain to engage in a play of hypotheses. On the other hand, the wall does not present us with very much in the way of visual clues, and so the brain begins to make more and more hypotheses and desperately searches for confirmation. A crack in the wall looks a little like the profile of a nose and suddenly a whole face appears, or a leaping horse, or a dancing figure.

But dematerialization is not just about digital goods. The reason even solid physical goods — like a soda can — can deliver more benefits while inhabiting less material is because their heavy atoms are substituted by weightless bits. The tangible is replaced by intangibles — intangibles like better design, innovative processes, smart chips, and eventually online connectivity — that do the work that more aluminum atoms used to do. Soft things, like intelligence, are thus embedded into hard things, like aluminum, that make hard things behave more like software.

Although richer people spend smaller proportions of their income on food, in total they consume more food —and richer food, which contributes to various kinds of disease and debilitation. The changes in diet that usually accompany higher incomes will require relatively greater increases in the production of feed grains, rather than food grains, as foods of animal origin partly displace plant-based foods in people’s diets. It takes two to six times more grain to produce food value through animals than to get the equivalent value directly from plants, It is thus quite credible to estimate that in order to meet economic and social needs within the next three to five decades, the world should be producing more than twice as much grain and agricultural products as at present, but in ways that these are accessible to the food-insecure.\")\n",
